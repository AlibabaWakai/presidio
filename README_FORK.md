# Installing Presidio

## 🔷 Method 1: pip install (Local Python Packages)
✅ gives you libraries & you build the app/service.

✅ If your resume repo is Python which is same language that Presidio is written in, stick with pip install.

This is useful if:
* You’re embedding Presidio into your own Python program.
* You want tight integration into your app’s codebase.
* You’re comfortable managing Python environments and dependencies.
* You need to write/run Python code that creates and starts the analyzer, anonymizer, etc. as services if you want to expose them as HTTP APIs.

## 🔷 Method 2: Docker images (Prebuilt Services)
✅ gives you full-fledged prebuilt services you just run.

✅ If your resume repo is not Python, use the Docker images.

This is useful if:
* You don’t want to deal with Python environments or dependencies.
* You want to deploy them quickly as microservices.
* You’re running them in an orchestration system (like Kubernetes, Docker Compose).

## 🔷 Method 3: From source:
✅ More transparency — you can inspect and modify the code.

✅ No dependency on pre-built Docker images.

✅ You can install in virtualenvs or system Python.

🧰 How to architect this:
📄 Data flow:
1️⃣ Users edit their resume via the Reactive Resume web UI.
2️⃣ When they save/export, your server converts the resume JSON into RenderCV’s YAML format (a simple mapping).
3️⃣ Pass the YAML to RenderCV’s CLI or API, and generate high-quality PDFs, LaTeX, etc.
4️⃣ Return the rendered output to the user.

🚀 Recommended plan:
✅ Reactive Resume → Docker
✅ Presidio → Docker
✅ RenderCV →

Start by installing it natively and running CLI directly (rendercv resume.yaml → PDF).

Optional later: build a simple Flask/FastAPI wrapper + Dockerize it.
