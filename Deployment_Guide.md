```

🚀 Next Steps After Installing Microsoft Presidio (Docker)
🧪 1️⃣ Verify the services are running
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see something like:
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              PORTS
abc123         presidio-analyzer:latest          5001/tcp
def456         presidio-anonymizer:latest        5002/tcp
```

🌐 2️⃣ Test the API endpoints
Presidio exposes REST APIs by default:

Analyzer
Test with curl:
✅ Option 1: One single line
Run as a single long line:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/analyze -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "My name is John Doe and my phone number is 555-123-4567", "language": "en"}'
```

✅ Option 2: Use a here-document
If you really want to write it nicely formatted:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/analyze \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @- <<EOF
{
  "text": "My name is John Doe and my phone number is 555-123-4567",
  "language": "en"
}
EOF
```
Here, @- tells curl to read the data from standard input, and the shell knows where it ends (EOF).

Expected response: JSON with detected entities:
```bash
[
  {"entity_type":"PERSON", "start":11, "end":19, ...},
  {"entity_type":"PHONE_NUMBER", "start":44, "end":56, ...}
]
```
